#Here the suggested solution had a slightly smarter approach, using a for loop for range between 1 and list length
#and the calculation of absolute value with the number prior, not after.
#No need for rep variable then, nor the hard coded +1 in the end.
#To update the winner variable, a max function was used within the loop.
